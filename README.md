# Regex_Engine

Technology: Python

Regular expressions are a fundamental part of computer science and natural language processing.
In this project, I have wrote an extendable regex engine that can handle basic regex syntax, 
including literals (a, b, c, etc.), wild-cards (.), and metacharacters (?, *, +, ^, $).
